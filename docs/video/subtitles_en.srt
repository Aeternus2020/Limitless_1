00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.000
Our Universe is a huge flat space,

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.400
which expands with acceleration.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.300
It is filled with galaxies, black holes, gas and more.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
But it was not always so.

5
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.200
The Big Bang occurred 13 billion 800 million years ago.

6
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.200
Up to this point, the universe was a singularity

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.000
- space infinitely compressed by high pressure,

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.000
inexplicably turned into our Universe.

9
00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.100
the early stages of the evolution of the universe are described by the Big Bang Theory.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.400
It is based on 3 fundamental discoveries of the 20th century.

11
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.200
Albert Einstein developed the theory of relativity

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.200
which explained the actions of gravity on the scale of the universe.

13
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.000
Alexander Fridman developed the theory of the Expanding Universe.

14
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000
he formulated the idea that the universe has a space-time frame.

15
00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.000
Penzias and Wilson investigated radio interference and accidentally discovered relic radiation

16
00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.000
 - emission of photons that appeared in the early stages of the origin of the Universe.

17
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.000
The question of how the singularity turned into the Universe is still open.

18
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.000
Therefore, in 1981, Allan Goode proposed the Inflationary Model,

19
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.000
which complemented the Big Bang Theory.

20
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.200
Inflation is the earliest state of the universe

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.000
about which we know something.

22
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.200
It lasted the smallest fraction of a second.

23
00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.000
During this time, the Universe has expanded several million times.

24
00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.300
and acquired a homogeneous structure.

25
00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.000
She was pure energy,

26
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.800
evenly distributed in space.

27
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.100
Therefore, today the space of space

28
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.100
evenly filled with objects

29
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.000
and has on average the same temperature.

30
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.000
At the end of the inflation stage, the rate of expansion of the Universe fell,

31
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:53.000
and energy began to turn into matter.

32
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.300
Elementary particles appeared

33
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.300
quarks, gluons, then protons and neutrons.


34
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.300
The particles began to collide with each other

35
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.300
The universe has warmed up to temperatures at least 10,000 times that of the sun.


36
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.300
At the same time, there was a struggle between matter and antimatter.


37
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.300
Opposite particles collided and annihilated


38
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.500
that is, they turned into photons.


39
00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.200
The fight continued until the antimatter completely disappeared.


40
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.800
Then the Universe entered the stage of Nucleosynthesis,


41
00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.100
the temperature dropped and in about 100 seconds the nuclei of future atoms were formed.


42
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.300
The universe was uniformly filled with protons, Helium, Boron and Deuterium,

43
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000
those substances from which stars were formed hundreds of millions of years later.

44
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.100
Over the next 380 thousand years, the temperature of the universe dropped

45
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.000
and under new conditions the first atoms were formed.

46
00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.000
Space began to transmit thermal radiation of photons through itself

47
00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.000
or relic radiation.

48
00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.000
It still fills the entire space of the universe.

49
00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.000
So the dark ages came.

50
00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.000
And the first stars appeared in the Universe only after 800 million years.
